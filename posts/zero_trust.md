Zero Trust is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access.

## Core Principles

1.  **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
2.  **Use Least Privileged Access**: Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA).
3.  **Assume Breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access.

This approach shifts the focus from perimeter-based security to data-centric security.
